PURPOSE
-------

* failwrite_preload and failwrite_ptrace are executable wrappers that lie to
  the programs they execute about the result of write operations to specific
  named files. This capability may be useful in testing the error handling of
  other programs upon write failure. Both take a POSIX regular expression to
  determine which files should be lied about.

USAGE
-----

General usage is the same for both programs:

  failwrite_* <pattern> /path/to/executable [<arguments>]

For example:

  failwrite_ptrace 'test*' /usr/bin/perl -e \
    'open $f, ">test.txt"; print $f 1; die "write error" unless close $f'

MECHANISM
---------

* failwrite_ptrace intercepts the "open" system call to know which file
  descriptors match the regular expression. It modifies the return value of the
  "write" syscall for such interesting files to indicate failure.

* Similarly, failwrite_preload intercepts glibc's open(2) call to track
  interesting file descriptors and intercepts write(2) to prevent writes to
  them.

CAVEATS
-------

* With failwrite_ptrace, only the actual write syscalls are intercepted. I/O
  libraries (e.g. stdio in C or PerlIO in Perl) which do buffered output on
  filehandles may not appear to fail until the handle is closed. Be sure to
  program must check the return value of fclose as well as fwrite.

* failwrite_ptrace doesn't prevent the write syscall from occurring, it just
  modifies the return value. If there was no actual error, the write will in
  fact succeed. failwrite_preload on the other hand will not perform the write
  during simulated failure.

* failwrite_preload only works with programs which use the libc write(2)
  function. This may not include things you would hope for; for instance,
  libc's own fprintf doesn't use it, nor does Perl's layered I/O system.

* failwrite_ptrace only works on i386 and x86_64 Linux systems.

* failwrite_preload only works on Linux systems with a glibc major version of 6.

* failwrite_ptrace cannot be used with strace in -f mode (or similar tools
  which also use ptrace to inspect children)
